    <h1>Shahadah - The First Pillar of Islam</h1>
  </header>
  <main>
    <h2>The Importance of Faith in Islam</h2>
    <p>The importance of faith in Islam becomes profoundly evident when we examine the core tenets of this religion. Among the Five Pillars of Islam, the declaration of faith (<span class="highlight">Shahadah</span>) holds a position of unparalleled significance. It is prohibited in Islam to compel someone into accepting the faith, as true acceptance must come from the heart. One has to sincerely testify and acknowledge the words of the Shahadah to become a Muslim.</p>

    <h2>Shahadah Meaning</h2>
    <p>The Shahadah stands as the foremost and pivotal pillar of Islam. It represents the core belief and a sincere declaration of faith and trust in which a person acknowledges and affirms that:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>لَا اِلٰہ اَلَّا اللہُ محمد رَّسُول اللہ</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The above written is the representation of Shahadah in Arabic, which states:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>“There is no God except Allah عَزَّ وَجَلَّ and the Beloved Last Prophet Muhammad صَلَّی اللہُ تَعَالٰی عَلَیْہِ وَاٰلِہٖ وَسَلَّمَ is the Messenger of Allah عَزَّ وَجَلَّ.”</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The meaning of Shahadah in Islam is encapsulated in its two distinct parts:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The first part means that "none is worthy to be worshipped but Allah عَزَّ وَجَلَّ alone, and that Allah عَزَّ وَجَلَّ has neither partner nor son."</li>
      <li>The second part asserts that "محمد صَلَّی اللہُ تَعَالٰی عَلَیْہِ وَاٰلِہٖ وَسَلَّمَ is the last Messenger of Allah عَزَّ وَجَلَّ."</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Virtue of the Declaration of Shahadah</h2>
    <p>Hazrat Ubada bin Samit رَضِىَ الـلّٰـهُ عَـنْهُ narrated about the virtue of the declaration of faith:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>"If anyone testifies that there is no god but God and that Muhammad is God's messenger, God will keep him from going to hell."</p>

    <h3>Types of the Descriptions of Faith</h3>
    <p>There are two types of descriptions of faith:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><span class="highlight">Iman-e-Mujmal:</span> "I solemnly declare my belief in Allah عَزَّ وَجَلَّ as He is with all His names and attributes, and I have accepted (to obey) all His commandments by pledging with my tongue and testifying them with my heart."</li>
      <li><span class="highlight">Iman-e-Mufassal:</span> "I believe in Allah عَزَّ وَجَلَّ, His Angels, His (revealed) Books, His Prophets, the Day of Judgment, and (I believe that) good and bad destiny is from Allah عَزَّ وَجَلَّ and (I believe that) there will be resurrection after death."</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Faith in Allah عَزَّ وَجَلَّ</h3>
    <p>To fully grasp the essence of Islam, it is essential to internalize the profound significance of Tawhid in Islam, the cornerstone of belief in the Oneness of Allah عَزَّوَجَلَّ.</p>
