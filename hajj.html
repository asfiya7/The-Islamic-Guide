            <p>Hajj, the <span class="highlight">fifth pillar of Islam</span>, is a pilgrimage undertaken to the holy city of Makkah during the month of Zul-Ḥijjah. The date of Hajj in the Islamic calendar begins on the 8th of Dhul Hijjah and lasts until the 13th of Dhul Hijjah. This profound journey, marked by its challenges, is an obligatory endeavor for financially and physically capable Muslims.</p>

            <p>It involves completing the designated rituals of Hajj in honor of Allah عَزَّوَجَلَّ. Those who successfully accomplish this voyage earn the esteemed title of Ḥaji. Every year, millions of Muslims gather in Makkah for the Hajj festival—the sacred Muslim pilgrimage—underscoring the unity of humanity and their equal devotion before Allah عَزَّوَجَلَّ.</p>

            <h2>A Significant Religious Gathering</h2>
            <p>As a fundamental and fifth pillar of Islam, Hajj holds immense significance as an act of worship. Every year, multitudes of Muslims wear simple and identical attire, transcending differences in color and race, setting aside discord to assemble in the sanctified precincts of the Haram. The world stands amazed at this extraordinary display of harmony.</p>

            <p>This juncture bestows unparalleled blessings upon the pilgrims, endowing them with Allah's عَزَّوَجَلَّ special favor. The gifts bestowed upon these fortunate individuals in return for their Hajj experience arouse a profound longing among less privileged Muslims, igniting a fervent aspiration to embark on a sacred journey of their own.</p>

            <h2>Types of Hajj</h2>
            <p>There are three types of Pilgrimage in Islam:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Qiran</li>
                <li>Tamattu</li>
                <li>Ifrad</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>1. Qiran</h3>
            <p>This is the most favored form of Hajj, termed as Qiran. Those embarking on this Hajj are referred to as Qarin. In this type, the pilgrim declares the intention for both Hajj and Umrah simultaneously upon entering the state of Ihram.</p>

            <p><span class="highlight">Intention of Hajj Qiran:</span></p>
            <blockquote>
                “Ya Allah عَزَّوَجَلَّ! I make the intention of Hajj and Umrah, make both of them easy for me and accept them from me. I have made the intention of Hajj and Umrah and have put on the Ihram of both just for the sake of Allah عَزَّوَجَلَّ.”
            </blockquote>

            <h3>2. Tamattu</h3>
            <p>A pilgrim undertaking this form of Hajj is known as a Mutamatte. Those arriving from beyond the Miqat during the Hajj months are eligible to perform this type. For instance, individuals from the Indo-Pak region commonly opt for Tamattu.</p>

            <h3>3. Ifrad</h3>
            <p>The individual undertaking this variation of Hajj is referred to as a Mufrid. This category of Hajj solely involves assuming the Ihram for Hajj without incorporating Umrah. Those residing within Makkah and Hilli, essentially the region between the Haram area and Miqat, opt for Hajj Ifrad.</p>

            <h2>Rewards & Blessings of an Accepted Pilgrimage</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The Prophet Muhammad صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم said: “The reward of an accepted Hajj is not less than Paradise.”</li>
                <li>An accepted Hajj is characterized by sincerity, charity, and abstaining from sin.</li>
