        <h1>Fasting - The Fourth Pillar of Islam</h1>
        <p>The fourth pillar of Islam is Fasting, which requires Muslims to fast during the sacred month of Ramadan. Ramadan fasting rules are that every pubescent Muslim is obligated to observe fasting, refraining from food, drink, and sexual activity throughout the fasting hours.</p>

        <h2>Purpose of Fasting</h2>
        <p>The purpose of Ramadan fasting in Islam is to enhance one's piety and provides an opportunity to empathize with the hunger and hardship experienced by the less fortunate. It instills discipline, strengthens one's devotion and religious commitment, fosters a deeper awareness of God and His favors, and serves as a method for seeking forgiveness.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>“O those who believe! Roza has been made obligatory upon you as were made obligatory upon those before you, so that you may become pious. The days are counted. Then whosoever among you is ill or on a journey then same number of fasting in other days, and those who have no strength, should give in fine meal to a needy: then whosoever does better, then that is better for him, and fasting is better for you if you know.”</p>
            <cite>— Surah Al-Baqarah (Part 2, Ayah 183-184)</cite>
        </blockquote>

        <h2>Roza Essentials - For Whom Fasting is Compulsory</h2>
        <p>Fasting during Ramadan is obligatory upon every accountable (male and female) Muslim who has attained puberty and is sane.</p>

        <h2>Importance of Fasting</h2>
        <p>The significance of fasting in Islam is reflected in its ability to connect individuals to their faith. The act of fasting teaches discipline and dedication, reflecting the practices of the Prophet Muhammad (صَلَّى الـلّٰـهُ عَلَيْهِ وَاٰلِهٖ وَسَلَّم) and his seclusion in the cave of Hira during Ramadan.</p>

        <h2>Unseen Strength - A Testament of Deep Faith</h2>
        <p>Fasting demonstrates a believer's unwavering faith in Allah عَزَّ وَجَلَّ, as they abstain from food and drink even in solitude, solely for the sake of Allah.</p>

        <h2>Benefits of Fasting</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Health Benefits:</strong> Fasting promotes good health and serves as a detox for the body.</li>
            <li><strong>Prevents Illness:</strong> Roza does not cause illness; improper eating habits during Ramadan are often the cause.</li>
            <li><strong>Spiritual Benefits:</strong> Fasting fosters spiritual growth, humility, and inner peace.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Quranic Verses & Hadith on Fasting</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The Quran states: “O those who believe! Fasting has been made obligatory upon you as were made obligatory upon those before you, so that you may become pious.”</li>
            <li>“For every act of piety, man is rewarded ten to seven hundred times more. Allah عَزَّ وَجَلَّ said except fasting, because fasting is for Me and I will give its reward Myself.”</li>
            <li>“Roza is a shield; when any of you fast, he should neither utter words of indecency nor shout.”</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Levels of Fasting</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Fast of Common People:</strong> Avoid eating, drinking, and intimacy from dawn to sunset.</li>
            <li><strong>Fast of the Pious:</strong> Refrain from all forms of wrongdoing.</li>
            <li><strong>Fast of the Ascetic:</strong> Dedicate oneself fully to Allah's worship and avoid all worldly distractions.</li>
        </ul>
